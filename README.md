## Prerequisites

This package has been tested under [ROS] Kinetic Kame and Ubuntu 16.04.

In order to use this package please follow [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/pepper/Tutorials) to setup your Pepper platform properly.

As we use Pepper's depth camera you have to calibrate it, to do so you can follow [this tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/pepper/Tutorials/Calibration#Depth_camera_calibration).

## Installation

	cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	git clone https://github.com/mreimbold/pepper_mapping.git
	source ../devel/setup.bash
	rosdep install pepper_mapping

## Usage

Starting the bridge on Pepper

	roslaunch pepper_bringup pepper_full.launch nao_ip:=<yourRobotIP> roscore_ip:=<roscore_ip> [network_interface:=<eth0|wlan0|vpn0>]

Run the main node with

	roslaunch pepper_mapping pepper_mapping.launch

Run RViz to see the laser scan and the created 2D Map with

	roslaunch pepper_mapping pepper_mapping_rviz.launch
